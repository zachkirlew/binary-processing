# binary-processing

Haskell program that takes a collection of machine-readable cataloging records (MARC) and converts it into a HTML doc that lists the titles and authors of every book in the collection.

Download any mrc file from https://ia802604.us.archive.org/18/items/marc_oregon_summit_records/catalog_files/ and save as "sample.mrc" in the project root to test.
